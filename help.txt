WebChat Script Help
Last Revised 02OCT2023

=======
Install
=======
git clone https://github.com/km4ack/webchat.git $HOME/webchat && bash $HOME/webchat/install

=======
Depends
=======
The following apps must be installed in addition to this software:
direwolf - if using direwolf. (not needed for Mobilinkd)
flrig - if used for rig control. (not needed for Mobilinkd)
hamlib - if using flrig. (not needed for Mobilinkd)

Each of the above needs to be installed and configured by the user
before installing WebChat. This can be skipped if just using
the Mobilinkd TNC.

=======================
Opening the Chat Client
=======================
The chat client will open in the firefox browser after you
choose either Direwolf Local, Direwolf Network, or Mobilinkd.
You can also open the page manually by opening the browser
and navigating to 127.0.0.1:8888

If Firefox is not installed on your computer, you will need
to manually open the browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8888
or updaate the webchat script with the full path to your 
browser. This can be found at the top of the webchat script.

==============
Direwolf Local
==============
Use this option if you have direwolf running on your local machine.
Direwolf must be installed and configured before starting WebChat.

================
Direwolf Network
================
Use this option if Direwolf is running on another machine that you 
can connect to over the network. Direwolf must be configured and
running before starting this option.

=========
Mobilinkd
=========
Use this option if you want to use a Mobilinkd TNC instead of 
Direwolf. WebChat supports the Mobilinkd TNC 2, 3, & 4.

The Mobilinkd TNC must be paired with the computer before using
this option. Use the Bluetooth GUI interface on your computer
to pair the Mobilinkd. Once paired, the TNC will disconnect
within a few seconds or you may get a notice that "No usable
services found for this device". This is expected!

Use the Mobilinkd app to verify PTT settings and audio levels.

It may take multiple tries in the WebChat app to start the
Mobilinkd service. Assuming you have paired the device with
your computer, try starting the Mobilinkd a few time if it
doesn't succeed at first. After a few tries, a reboot might
help.

Coordinates
===========
To get the correct coordinates for your position, go to Google maps
in your browser. Left click on the map at your desired location.
Look in the bottom center of the screen for the lat/long coordinates.
Enter these coordinates into the WebChat settings.

===========
Rig Control
===========
If you will be using FLRIG for rig control, set this option to "Yes".
This option is primarily used for local direwolf. It should be set
to "No" for the Mobilinkd TNC. If using direwolf network, the rig 
control will be handled by the networked computer running direwolf.
